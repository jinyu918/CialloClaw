# CI Scripts

This directory hosts repository checks that must stay runnable from both local
development and GitHub Actions.

## Local-Service Go Style

Run the local-service style gate before submitting backend Go changes:

```powershell
go run ./scripts/ci/local-service-style
go vet ./services/local-service/...
go run honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck ./services/local-service/...
go test ./services/local-service/...
```

`local-service-style` verifies that `goimports` has been applied to changed Go
files under `services/local-service` and rejects newly added Chinese Go
comments in local-service diffs. In pull requests, CI passes the base SHA so
the guard checks only new changes instead of failing on historical debt that is
outside the current change boundary. In local mode, the comment guard evaluates
staged hunks against the index snapshot and unstaged hunks against the working
tree, so partial staging in the same file does not skew reported line numbers.

The repository pins `goimports` and `staticcheck` through the root [`go.mod`](../go.mod),
so local runs and CI stay on the same tool versions until the module is
intentionally updated.
